# Objective
This project explores how historical player performance metrics, team success, and contextual factors can be used to model and evaluate NBA MVP candidacy. Using past seasons as training data, the goal is to build an explainable framework that approximates how MVP voting outcomes have historically emerged, and to experiment with its application to future seasons.

# Problem Statement
The NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award is decided through a voting process that is heavily influenced by narrative, media framing, and season-specific context. Evaluation criteria are not formally standardized and often vary across eras, making MVP outcomes difficult to explain, compare, or model consistently.

As a result, purely statistical approaches often fail to capture how MVP candidates are realistically evaluated. This project investigates whether a structured, data-driven framework—combining individual performance metrics with contextual and team-level factors—can better approximate historical MVP voting patterns while remaining transparent and interpretable.

# Project Status
🚧 Work in Progress (Learning & Research Project)

This repository is actively updated as assumptions are tested, features are refined, and modeling approaches evolve. Insights, limitations, and corrections are documented throughout the project to reflect the iterative nature of real-world data science work.
